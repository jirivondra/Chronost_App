# API change checklist

`api/main.py` changes trigger `.github/workflows/postman-sync.yml` on push to `main` (it watches the paths `api/main.py` and `postman-sync/**`). That workflow opens a PR in the separate [chronos_postman_colection](https://github.com/jirivondra/chronos_postman_colection) repo to keep the Postman collection in sync with the OpenAPI spec.

Two things make this easy to miss:

- The workflow only watches `api/main.py` and `postman-sync/**` — a PR that bundles an API change together with unrelated frontend/CI work (e.g. a squashed multi-commit PR) still triggers it, even if the API change wasn't the PR's main focus.
- It **never merges automatically**. It opens the PR and stops — a human always reviews and merges. It also opens the PR **even when the live collection run against the API fails**; only the workflow run itself is then marked failed, so a green Chronost_App PR doesn't guarantee the sync PR is clean.

## What to do

Whenever a change that touches `api/main.py` is pushed or merged to `main`:

1. Check whether `postman-sync` fired for that commit:
   ```bash
   gh run list -R jirivondra/Chronost_App --workflow "Sync Postman Collection" --limit 5 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,headSha
   ```
2. Find the resulting PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr list -R jirivondra/chronos_postman_colection --state open --json number,title,url
   ```
3. Hand the user **both** links together, unprompted — the Chronost_App PR and the `chronos_postman_colection` sync PR. Don't wait to be asked; that defeats the point.
4. If the workflow run itself failed even though the PR opened, say so. The PR body's "Collection run" section names which requests failed and why — read that (or the workflow run's logs) before reporting it, don't just flag it as a black box.

A change that doesn't touch `api/main.py` (frontend HTML, `api/soap_calculator.py`, CI workflow files, test repos, etc.) never triggers this — no need to check.
